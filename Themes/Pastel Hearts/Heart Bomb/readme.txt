Description.
==========

Each message received will popup a heart. If a command is entered by streamer/mods a heart bomb animation will popup instead. The command and amount of heart can be configured in custom fields section. You can also remove the streamer/mod only requirement but it is not recommended because might lag if theres too much popup, idk my laptop too slow and lag anyways so i'm not sure.

! Warning
==========
If you enabled the 'hide chatter option' in Streamlabs, use themename-hide-chatter.js file instead of the normal themename.js file.
