Tips:

Each file can be open with notepad (right click > open with > notepad).

Some theme have more functionality, but you can manually add them if you want.
Code for these functionality is in the 'Snippets' folder.
You can use multiple chatbox theme for different scene in obs.
You can do so by going into 'Manage Theme' in streamlabs website (create new theme!).
Each different theme have different url you can use as browser source.
You can modified each of those theme's chatbox.

For overlay makers/designers.

- You are allowed to use this overlay in your commissions/products, paid or not.
- Credits appreciated but is not required. Just don't go around claiming you make it.
- No payment to me is needed.
- If you want, you can tip me (1USD per customer is more than enough),
if you want to help me as i'm trying to upgrade from my really slow laptop to a proper desktop pc.
But it's not a big deal, i'm already happy if more people use my scuff overlay.
