Time Is Now
==========

Each file can be open with notepad (right click > open with > notepad).

Description.
==========

- First chat element might be missing timestamp or background-color (If chat loaded too fast before js executed).
- Username does not have background thus, you have to play around text-shadow to ensure it is visible in all screen conditions, dark/light.


! Warning
==========
Does not support 'hide chatter option' in Streamlabs. Might add later, no promises.
