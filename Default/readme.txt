// Default Template.

This template is targeted at those who wants spend lots of time to customize every little things.
It has the most options but it will look bad if you mindlessly alter all options and don't have a style in mind.
If you only want to change simple things, try the templates in premades folder instead.
It has less option to customize but already have a style to begin with.
