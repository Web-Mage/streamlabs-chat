Streamelements custom chatbox widget for your Twitch overlay with basic customization options. First theme I made for Streamelements, so only small customization available, might add more as I learn their system.

Changed default font.

07 December 2021
Fixed Google font selection.

06 December 2021

✨ What can you customize?

Font, font size & weight.

Username & message color.

Message background & border color.

✨ Question?

Will this theme get updates with more options?
I don't know yet. Sold as is. No promises for any future things.

But I need more customization.
You can manually edit the code [css, javascript, html] yourself if you desired.

I need help installing the widget.
The instruction is included in the folder. You can contact me on Twitter for further help but I will only respond when I'm free or able to.

Does this theme supports Facebook, Youtube or Trovo?
I don't know. Tested for Twitch only.
