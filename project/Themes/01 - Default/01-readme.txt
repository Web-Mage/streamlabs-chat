Description.
==========

This default template is targeted at those who want to spend lots of time to customize every little things.
It has the most options but it will look bad if you mindlessly alter all options and don't have a style in mind.
If you only want to change simple things, try other themes instead.
Other themes has less option to customize but already have a style to begin with.

! Warning
==========
If you enabled the 'hide chatter option' in Streamlabs, use themename-hide-chatter.js file instead of the normal themename.js file.
