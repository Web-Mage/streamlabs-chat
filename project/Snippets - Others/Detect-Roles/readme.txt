// NOT A TEMPLATE. Stuffs i've learned and currently learning.

Example of what you can do with js obj.

1. You can detect if a user if a mod/subscriber/broadcaster and append class to them/run function.
2. You can detect specific user and change their name, style, give unique image, trigger anything etc.

=======

IDK if you can detect sub tier in chat (you can in event list widget).
OBJ data id from Streamlabs. Twitch might add new data anytime.
