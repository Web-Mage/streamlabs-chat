Showcasing buch of different designs, concepts, example of what more can you do with the widget.

Some other template from previous builds is otw. will add them back later after.

!! I only minimaly tested themes in this folder on my web browser because my cheap laptop cannot run multiple programs like obs/my code editor/ browser at the same time without lagging hard. It is recommended that you fine tune the design by yourself because it might look different. In browser, nothing running in the background but in obs/stream your game is running. Different situation (light/dark) will effect the clarity of the widget.
