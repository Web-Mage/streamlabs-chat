Example of what you can do with js obj.

1. You can detect if a user if a mod/subscriber/broadcaster and append class to them.
2. You can detect specific user and change their name, style, give unique image, trigger anything etc.

=======


IDK if you can detect sub tier in chat (you can in event list widget). 
I have no real obj data from real user, so i don't know other parameters/variables 
that streamlabs uses. If you can give them to me, please do so.
