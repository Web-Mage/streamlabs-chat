Does not support option to hide message after x seconds because it conflicted with message rendered. To be specific, the fadeout animation (animate.css) somehow (sometimes) makes the bottom of the message rendered (about 1px) hidden/flickered. You can enable the option in css by comment back in the code at line 48 and 49. Might be browser specific bug idk might be my laptop only.
